## question

## ☆ let me show best practice handling initialization of variable.　when first login and user does not input any data, all variable have no data which return validation error. should i fill dummy variable on load, or refrain varidation on first load?

## answer

Initialization of variables and handling validation in an application, especially when dealing with user input upon first login, is a critical part of creating a smooth user experience. Here are some best practices:

### Best Practices for Initialization of Variables

#### 1. Use Sensible Defaults

For required fields, provide sensible defaults where possible. Defaults can help reduce the user's cognitive load and prevent validation errors when the user hasn't actively entered data.

```javascript
const defaultSettings = {
  theme: 'light',
  notifications: true
  // ... other settings
}
```

#### 2. Lazy Validation

Validate inputs lazily, meaning you should validate only when the focus moves away from an input field (on blur) or when the form is submitted. Initial validation on load can be an annoyance to users, as they haven't had a chance to interact yet.

```javascript
form.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
  // Perform validation on submit instead of on load.
  if (!isFormValid(form)) {
    event.preventDefault()
    displayValidationErrors()
  }
})
```

#### 3. Handle Empty States

Explicitly handle the case where no data is present. This might mean disabling certain features until the necessary information is provided by the user post-login.

```javascript
if (userData.isComplete()) {
  enableFeatures()
} else {
  disableFeatures()
  promptUserForInformation()
}
```

#### 4. User Guidance

When fields are required but not yet filled in, guide the user towards taking action without showing harsh validation messages immediately.

```javascript
if (isFirstLogin && !user.hasProvidedRequiredData()) {
  showMessage('Please complete your profile.')
} else {
  hideMessage()
}
```

#### 5. Avoid Dummy Data

Refrain from using dummy data to pass validation checks. Instead, design your application logic to account for 'empty' states of variables.

### Code Sample: Handling First Login

Here's an illustrative example of best practice:

```javascript
class UserSession {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user
    this.isFirstLogin = !user.lastLoginDate
  }

  initialize() {
    if (this.isFirstLogin) {
      // Guide user through required steps without enforcing validation just yet
      this.promptUserToCompleteProfile()
    } else {
      // Validate user data if needed
      this.validateUserData()
    }
  }

  promptUserToCompleteProfile() {
    // Implementation to show user prompts/messages
  }

  validateUserData() {
    // User data validation implementation
    if (this.hasValidationErrors(this.user.data)) {
      this.showValidationErrors()
    }
  }

  // Additional methods...
}

// Usage of UserSession
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  const userSession = new UserSession(currentUser)
  userSession.initialize()
})
```

These guidelines should ensure that your application is user-friendly while maintaining the integrity of the data through appropriate variable initialization and validation.

## ☆ To capture and handle `ZodError` without causing an interruption in your code flow, you can use a try-catch block. When using the `zod` library for schema validation in JavaScript or TypeScript, any validation errors will throw a `ZodError` instance. By catching this error, you can handle it gracefully according to your application's needs.

Here's an example of how you might implement this:

```javascript
import { z, ZodError } from 'zod'

// Define your schema
const mySchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number().positive()
})

// The data you want to validate
const dataToValidate = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: -5 // This will cause a validation error because age must be positive
}

try {
  // Attempt to parse the data to validate against the schema
  const parsedData = mySchema.parse(dataToValidate)

  // If no exception was thrown, the data is valid
  console.log('Validation passed:', parsedData)
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ZodError) {
    // Handle the captured ZodError here
    console.error('Validation failed with ZodError:', error.errors) // Log or process the errors

    // Optionally, you could store the error somewhere if needed
    const storedError = error
    // Use 'storedError' as required by your application's logic
  } else {
    // It wasn't a ZodError, maybe something else went wrong
    console.error('An unexpected error occurred:', error)
  }
}
```

In this example, the `try` block is where you attempt to validate your data. If there's a validation error, `zod` will throw a `ZodError`, which we then catch in the catch block. Inside the catch, we check that the caught error is actually an instance of `ZodError` before proceeding to handle it.

By handling `ZodError` this way, the execution of your program won't be interrupted by unexpected validation issues; instead, you have control over how to respond to those validation errors.

---

## ☆ Using Zod to validate each element of your form individually is a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### Step 1: Define Your Zod Schema

Start by defining the Zod schema for your entire object. Here's an example schema for an object with `name`, `age`, and `email` fields:

```javascript
import * as z from 'zod'

const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Name is required'),
  age: z.number().min(18, 'You must be at least 18 years old'),
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email address')
})
```

### Step 2: Validate Individual Form Inputs

To validate individual form inputs against the defined schema, you can use the `.safeParse` method provided by Zod for each field.

Here's an example of how to validate the `name` field:

```javascript
function validateName(nameValue) {
  const result = userSchema.shape.name.safeParse(nameValue)

  if (result.success) {
    // Name is valid
    console.log('Valid name:', result.data)
  } else {
    // Name is invalid
    console.error('Invalid name:', result.error.issues)
  }
}
```

For the `age` field:

```javascript
function validateAge(ageValue) {
  const result = userSchema.shape.age.safeParse(parseInt(ageValue, 10))

  if (result.success) {
    // Age is valid
    console.log('Valid age:', result.data)
  } else {
    // Age is invalid
    console.error('Invalid age:', result.error.issues)
  }
}
```

And for the `email` field:

```javascript
function validateEmail(emailValue) {
  const result = userSchema.shape.email.safeParse(emailValue)

  if (result.success) {
    // Email is valid
    console.log('Valid email:', result.data)
  } else {
    // Email is invalid
    console.error('Invalid email:', result.error.issues)
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Attach Validators to Form Inputs

In your form, you would attach these validation functions to corresponding form inputs' events, such as `onBlur` or `onChange`.

Below is an example of HTML input elements with attached validators:

```html
<input type="text" name="name" onBlur="validateName(this.value)" />
<input type="number" name="age" onBlur="validateAge(this.value)" />
<input type="email" name="email" onBlur="validateEmail(this.value)" />
```

Replace the inline event handlers with your preferred way of handling events if you are using a JavaScript framework or library like React, Vue, or Angular.

### Step 4: Display Validation Messages

You can also modify the validation functions to return the validation messages so that you can display them next to your form inputs.

Remember to replace the console logs and errors with the actual logic that updates the UI accordingly. This might include setting error state variables or directly manipulating the DOM to show error messages.

By following these steps, you should be able to validate each field in your form individually using a Zod schema.

---

## ☆ To force overwrite the `current-branch` with the contents of `new-branch` using `git merge`, you can use the following steps:

**Warning: Proceed with caution as this will overwrite changes in `current-branch`. Any changes that are not in `new-branch` will be lost.**

1. Checkout to the `current-branch`:

   ```bash
   git checkout current-branch
   ```

2. Perform a merge with the `new-branch` using the `ours` merge strategy. This strategy will resolve any conflict by keeping the content of the branch that you have currently checked out (`current-branch`), essentially ignoring all changes from `new-branch`.

   ```bash
   git merge -s ours new-branch
   ```

3. Now, the `current-branch` effectively has precedence over the changes from `new-branch`, but we need to actually get the content from `new-branch`. To do so, we'll perform a hard reset to the `new-branch`.

   ```bash
   git reset --hard new-branch
   ```

This set of commands will point `current-branch` to the same commit as `new-branch`, thus making `current-branch` an exact copy of `new-branch` and forcing an overwrite of any conflicting changes.

### Remember that if others are working on the same repository, forcibly rewriting history with these kinds of operations can cause significant disruption to their workflows. Always coordinate with your team before performing such actions.

---

## ☆ No, the above method is designed to be used locally on your branch within your local repository. If you want to overwrite a remote branch with the state of another branch, you'll use a combination of local operations and a force push.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Checkout to the `new-branch` which has the desired state you want to push.

   ```bash
   git checkout new-branch
   ```

2. Ensure your local `new-branch` is up to date with the remote.

   ```bash
   git pull origin new-branch
   ```

3. Force push `new-branch` to `current-branch` on the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin +new-branch:current-branch
   ```
   The `+` sign before the `new-branch` tells Git to force the push.

This command says: "Take the current state of `new-branch` and force it onto `current-branch` on the remote repository."

**Please note**: This is a destructive action that will overwrite the `current-branch` in the remote repository, replacing its history and content with that of `new-branch`. Any changes on the `current-branch` that are not in `new-branch` will be lost.

Always make sure you understand the consequences of this action:

- Other people's work might be based on `current-branch` and force pushing will disrupt their workflow.
- Any branches that were branched off from `current-branch` after the divergence point with `new-branch` will have conflicts when they next try to merge or rebase.

It is best practice to coordinate with your team when you force push changes to a shared repository.

---

## ☆ To make use of generics `<T>` along with a type validation library like Zod, you'll have to create a generic type guard that can accept any Zod schema as an argument and then use that schema to validate whether the data is of type `T`. Here’s how you might implement such a function:

```typescript
import { ZodSchema } from 'zod'

function createIsOfTypeT<T>(schema: ZodSchema<T>): (data: any) => data is T {
  return (data: any): data is T => {
    return schema.safeParse(data).success
  }
}
```

With this function in place, you can use it to create specific type guards for your `FctItem` and `DriItem` by passing their respective Zod schemas.

Here's an example of how you could set up your converters for `FctItem` and `DriItem` using their Zod schemas:

```typescript
// Import the necessary Zod libraries and your schemas
import { ZodSchema } from 'zod'
import { FctItemsZodSchema, DriItemsZodSchema } from './path-to-your-zod-schemas'

// Your existing FirestoreDataConverter that accepts a type guard
const converter = <T>(isOfTypeT: (data: any) => data is T): FirestoreDataConverter<T> => ({
  //...
})

// Create type guards using their respective Zod schemas
const isFctItem = createIsOfTypeT<FctItem>(FctItemsZodSchema)
const isDriItem = createIsOfTypeT<DriItem>(DriItemsZodSchema)

// Then use these type guards within your converter instantiation
const fctItemConverter = converter<FctItem>(isFctItem)
const driItemConverter = converter<DriItem>(isDriItem)
```

When you want to use your converters, provide them to the `.withConverter()` method for your queries or document references. For instance:

```typescript
const fctItemRef = doc(firestoreDb, 'fctItems', itemId).withConverter(fctItemConverter)

const driItemRef = doc(firestoreDb, 'driItems', itemId).withConverter(driItemConverter)
```

Using this pattern, each converter is now equipped with a specific type guard powered by Zod to perform runtime checks, ensuring type safety without duplicating validation logic in multiple places.

---

The issue seems to arise from using `this.converter2<T>(this.fctItemConverter)` which doesn't align with how `converter2` is defined. The `converter2` function expects a type guard `(data: any) => data is T`, but `this.fctItemConverter` is already an instance of `FirestoreDataConverter`. Here is the corrected code:

```typescript
import { FirestoreDataConverter, QueryDocumentSnapshot, WithFieldValue, DocumentData, doc, getDoc } from '@firebase/firestore';
import { ZodSchema } from 'zod';
import * as myVal from './myVal'; // Replace './myVal' with the correct path where FctItem and DriItem are defined

// Assuming splash is a function you have defined elsewhere:
function splash(show: boolean): void {
  // Some splash behavior
}

// Revised code below:

private static converter2<T>(isOfTypeT: (data: any) => data is T): FirestoreDataConverter<T> {
  return {
    toFirestore(data: WithFieldValue<T>): WithFieldValue<DocumentData> {
      if (data === null || typeof data !== 'object') {
        throw new Error('Data to send to Firestore must be an object / error in toFirestore');
      }
      return {...data} as WithFieldValue<DocumentData>;
    },
    fromFirestore(snapshot: QueryDocumentSnapshot): T {
      const data = snapshot.data();
      if (!isOfTypeT(data)) {
        throw new Error('Data from Firestore does not match expected type.');
      }
      return data;
    }
  };
}

// Basic validator
private static createIsOfTypeT<T>(schema: ZodSchema<T>): ((data: any) => data is T) {
  return (data: any): data is T => schema.safeParse(data).success;
}

// Create type guards using their respective Zod schemas
private static isFctItem = this.createIsOfTypeT(myVal.FctItemZod);
private static isDriItem = this.createIsOfTypeT(myVal.DriItemZod);

// Then use these type guards within your converter instantiation
private static fctItemConverter = this.converter2(this.isFctItem);
private static driItemConverter = this.converter2(this.isDriItem);

static async fireGetTyped2<T>(collectionId: string, docId: string): Promise<T | null> {
  let converter;
  if (this.isFctItem({})) { // Check if T matches FctItem
    converter = this.fctItemConverter as FirestoreDataConverter<T>;
  } else if (this.isDriItem({})) { // Check if T matches DriItem
    converter = this.driItemConverter as FirestoreDataConverter<T>;
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Converter for the specified type T is not found.`);
  }

  const docRef = doc(db, collectionId, docId).withConverter(converter);

  try {
    splash(true);
    const snapshot = await getDoc(docRef);
    splash(false);

    if (snapshot.exists()) {
      return snapshot.data();
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    splash(false);
    console.error(error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

In the above correction:

- The `converter2` function is now directly returning the converter object without being wrapped in another arrow function.
- Type checks have been added in the `fromFirestore` method of both converters to ensure the fetched data conforms to the expected type.
- Within `fireGetTyped2`, we determine which converter to use based on which type guard passes. In this example, I've used dummy objects `{}` to illustrate how you might select an appropriate converter. However, this may not be the correct logic for your use case—you'd have to implement logic that determines the type of `T` to choose the correct converter.
- I replaced `this.converter2<T>(this.fctItemConverter)` with a conditional assignment to the `converter` variable because you can't use a converter instance (`fctItemConverter`) as an argument for `converter2`.

Make sure that `db` is correctly instantiated and that `myVal.FctItem`, `myVal.DriItem`, `myVal.FctItemZod`, and `myVal.DriItemZod` are properly imported or defined.

---

Yes, you can add a type guard check within the `toFirestore` method. Here's how you can modify the converter to include that check:

```typescript
private static converter2<T>(isOfTypeT: (data: any) => data is T): FirestoreDataConverter<T> {
  return {
    toFirestore(data: WithFieldValue<T>): WithFieldValue<DocumentData> {
      if (!isOfTypeT(data)) {
        throw new Error('Provided data does not match expected type.');
      }
      // The data object has been validated and can be spread into the resulting object
      return {...data} as WithFieldValue<DocumentData>;
    },
    fromFirestore(snapshot: QueryDocumentSnapshot): T {
      const data = snapshot.data();
      if (!isOfTypeT(data)) {
        throw new Error('Data from Firestore does not match expected type.');
      }
      // The data object has been validated and matches type T
      return data;
    }
  };
}
```

With this modification, both `toFirestore` and `fromFirestore` methods now ensure that the data being handled confirms to type `T`. Calls to `toFirestore` will throw an error if trying to send data to Firestore that does not pass the type guard, providing a stricter check on outgoing as well as incoming Firestore data.

Please note that it is often the case that data being sent to Firestore may have additional fields such as `FieldValue`s for server timestamps, which might not strictly conform to the schema of `T`. In such cases, the type guard should be defined in a way that allows these special Firestore types for the write operations to succeed.

## ☆ i have set of variable (mostly array of objects) to be stored in pinia. i have set of pages to initialize each variables.　what is a best practice to handle initialization and set value into pinia one by one using vue3-typescript.　my problem is without initialization, i cannot set value in pinia (because typescript does not accept null)

---

When working with Pinia in a Vue 3 application using TypeScript, initializing and setting values for the store can be done in a way that ensures type safety and avoids issues with `null` or `undefined` values.

Here's a step-by-step guide to best practices for handling initialization and setting values:

### Step 1: Define Your Store with Initial State

Firstly, define your store with an initial state. This means providing default values for all properties. If a property is an array of objects, initialize it as an empty array.

```typescript
// store.ts
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

export const useMyStore = defineStore('myStore', {
  state: () => ({
    items: [] as MyObject[] // Replace MyObject with the actual object type
    // ... other states
  })
  // getters and actions
})
```

### Step 2: Type Your State

Type your state by defining interfaces or types for your objects. This helps TypeScript understand what structure your objects will have.

```typescript
// types.ts
export interface MyObject {
  id: number
  name: string
  // ...other properties
}
```

Then import this interface into your store file:

```typescript
// store.ts
import { MyObject } from './types'

// ... rest of the store code
```

### Step 3: Initialize Properties on Each Page

If you're initializing different parts of your store on different pages, provide a method within your store to handle the initialization of each part. Call these methods when the corresponding page is created or mounted.

```typescript
// store.ts
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
import { MyObject } from './types'

export const useMyStore = defineStore('myStore', {
  state: () => ({
    items: [] as MyObject[]
    // ... other states
  }),
  actions: {
    initializeItems(items: MyObject[]) {
      this.items = items
    }
    // ... other initialization methods
  }
})
```

In your page component, you would call this action when you want to initialize the `items`.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { onMounted } from 'vue'
import { useMyStore } from '@/stores/store'
import { fetchItems } from '@/api' // Assume this is a function to fetch your items

const myStore = useMyStore()

onMounted(async () => {
  const items = await fetchItems()
  myStore.initializeItems(items)
})
</script>
```

### Step 4: Handle Asynchronous Operations

If data initialization involves asynchronous operations like API calls, make sure to handle them properly using async/await or .then/.catch within your actions.

### Step 5: Utilize Non-null Assertion Operator if Needed

In cases where you are absolutely sure a value will not be `null` at runtime but TypeScript cannot infer that, you can use the non-null assertion operator (`!`). However, use this with caution as it bypasses TypeScript’s checks and can lead to runtime errors if misused.

```typescript
this.items!.push(newItem)
```

#### By following these steps, you can ensure that your Pinia store is properly typed and initialized, avoiding `null` or `undefined` issues with TypeScript in your Vue 3 application.

## ☆ i want to watch set of state variables in Pinia. everytime one variable is modified, name of this variable will be pushed into array named "modifiedStates". when user decided to save all modified variables, modifiedStates will be used to update all these variables into firestore. how can i enable this?

Yes, you can do that. If each state variable may have a different type, you could use the `any` type for the value parameter in your `updateStateValue` action to allow for any type of data to be assigned. However, using `any` might defeat the purpose of TypeScript's strong typing system.

A better approach might be to define a more precise type for the possible values in your state. Using a union type for the `value` parameter could help ensure that only valid types can be set to the state properties. Here's how you can adjust your code:

```typescript
import { defineStore } from 'pinia';

// Define a type for the acceptable types of state values
type StateValue = string | number | boolean | object | null; // Add more as needed

// Define a type for your state with specific types for each property
interface YourStoreState {
  variable1: string;
  variable2: number;
  variable3: object;
  modifiedStates: string[];
}

export const useYourStore = defineStore('yourStore', {
  state: (): YourStoreState => ({
    variable1: '',
    variable2: 0,
    variable3: {},
    modifiedStates: [],
  }),
  getters: {
    // Your getters (if any)
  },
  actions: {
    // Use StateValue for the value parameter
    updateStateValue(fieldName: keyof YourStoreState, value: StateValue) {
      if (this[fieldName] !== value) {
        this[fieldName] = value;

        // Ensure the field name is a part of the state before pushing to modifiedStates
        if (!this.modifiedStates.includes(fieldName)) {
          this.modifiedStates.push(fieldName);
        }
      }
    },

    async saveModifiedStates() {
      // Ensure updates object respects the state structure
      const updates: Partial<Record<keyof YourStoreState, StateValue>> = {};

      for (const fieldName of this.modifiedStates) {
        updates[fieldName] = this[fieldName];
      }

      const documentRef = /* Your Firestore document reference */;
      await documentRef.update(updates);

      this.modifiedStates = [];
    }
  },
});
```

In this adjusted code:

- `StateValue` is a union type that includes all the permissible types for state values.
- The `updates` object in `saveModifiedStates` method is now typed as `Partial<Record<keyof YourStoreState, StateValue>>`. This ensures that the keys must be those defined in `YourStoreState`, and the values must match one of the allowed types in `StateValue`.

This approach gives you some flexibility while still taking advantage of TypeScript's type checking. However, if your state has very specific requirements or complex nested objects, you'd need to create more detailed interfaces or types to describe it accurately.

---

Yes, you can introduce a generic type parameter `<T>` to the `updateStateValue` method to ensure that the value is of the correct type that corresponds to the specified field in your state object. To establish a relationship between `fieldName` and `T`, you would need to use a type that maps field names to their respective types.

Here's how you can set up an `updateStateValue` function using generics along with TypeScript's indexed access types:

```typescript
interface YourStoreState {
  variable1: string
  variable2: number
  variable3: SomeObjectType // Replace SomeObjectType with an actual type for this property, if needed.
  // ... more fields as needed
}

export const useYourStore = defineStore('yourStore', {
  state: (): YourStoreState => ({
    variable1: '',
    variable2: 0,
    variable3: {
      /* initial object structure */
    }
    // ... initial values for more fields
  }),
  actions: {
    updateStateValue<K extends keyof YourStoreState>(fieldName: K, value: YourStoreState[K]) {
      this[fieldName] = value
    }
  }
})
```

In this example:

- `K` is a generic type that is constrained to be a key of `YourStoreState`.
- The type of `value` directly depends on the `fieldName` provided and must match the type associated with that particular key in the state object (`YourStoreState[K]`).
- When you call `updateStateValue`, TypeScript will infer the type `K` from the provided `fieldName` argument and enforce that `value` is of the correct type.

Here's how you would use the `updateStateValue` function:

```typescript
// Assuming store is the instance of useYourStore()
store.updateStateValue('variable1', 'New String Value') // Works, because 'variable1' is a string
store.updateStateValue('variable2', 123) // Works, because 'variable2' is a number
store.updateStateValue('variable3', {
  /* new object */
}) // Needs to match the type of 'variable3'

// This will cause a type error:
store.updateStateValue('variable1', 123) // Error, because 'variable1' should be a string
```

Using this approach ensures that each field in the state gets updated with a value of the correct type, maintaining type safety throughout your application.

```
introduce unified function to save store value into fireStore


```

---

To make the code typesafe using `withConverter` from Firebase, you will first need to implement a converter that will ensure the data exchanged with Firestore maintains the correct structure and type according to `YourStoreState`.

In the code below, I've added a Firestore converter and modified the `updateStateValue` action to use `StateValue` while ensuring that the value types are correctly matched. The `saveModifiedStates` action is also updated so it uses this converter when interacting with Firestore.

```typescript
import {
  defineStore
} from 'pinia';
import {
  doc,
  updateDoc,
  WithFieldValue,
  DocumentData,
  FirestoreDataConverter
} from 'firebase/firestore';

// Define your state with specific types for each property
interface YourStoreState {
  variable1: string;
  variable2: number;
  variable3: object;
  modifiedStates: string[];
}

// Firestore converter to enforce the YourStoreState on reads/writes
const yourStoreConverter: FirestoreDataConverter<YourStoreState> = {
  toFirestore(state: WithFieldValue<YourStoreState>): DocumentData {
    return state;
  },
  fromFirestore(
    snapshot: FirebaseFirestore.QueryDocumentSnapshot
  ): YourStoreState {
    const data = snapshot.data();
    return {
      variable1: data.variable1,
      variable2: data.variable2,
      variable3: data.variable3,
      modifiedStates: data.modifiedStates,
    };
  }
};

export const useYourStore = defineStore('yourStore', {
  state: (): YourStoreState => ({
    variable1: '',
    variable2: 0,
    variable3: {},
    modifiedStates: [],
  }),
  getters: {
    // Your getters (if any)
  },
  actions: {
    updateStateValue(fieldName: keyof YourStoreState, value: StateValue) {

type StateValue = string | number | boolean | object | null; // Add more as needed
```

Please remember you will need to provide your actual Firestore instance and the path to your document where I've put the placeholders (`/* firestore instance */`, `/* path */`) in the `doc()` function.
